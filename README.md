An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of tools that provides a developer with the ability to build a custom app (like polaris).

# How can I help?
If you have a SDK (public or not public). You can Send them to me on Discord (Sparmage#0001) or make a Pull Request. I'd appriceate it! (The SDK has be in a zip file because github only allows 100 max file/folder upload)
